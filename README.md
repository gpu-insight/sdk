GPUInsightÂ® SDK & Samples
=========================

[GPUInsight](https://www.gpuinsight.com/) SDK provides the abstraction of drawing, texture and shader program operations in OpenGL API. Besides it also simplifies the presentation of 3D rendering and creation of OpenGL demo.

# Prerequisites
The following devel packages are required to compile this library.
- libEGL
- libGL
- libX11
- jpeg
- png
- glm
- cmake 3.9

# Build & Install
This project supports both of build systems, familiar CMake or faster [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/). It should be noted that the SDK library and samples are put together but the latter depends on the former. Consequently you'd better build the library before samples.

## CMake
```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

## Meson
```bash
meson build
meson compile -C build
meson install -C build
```
