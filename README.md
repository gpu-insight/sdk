# BOTSON SDK
The SDK encapsulates the manipulation of OpenGL texture, matrix, shaders and so on
in C++ so that it is easier to create an OpenGL application for developers.

## Build
```bash
scons
```

## Install
```bash
sudo scons install INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/install
```

Note that INSTALL_DIR is `/usr/local/botson` by default if it is omitted.
